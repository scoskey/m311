## Foundations

* Undefined terms
* Theory (postulates / axioms)
* Model
* Defined terms
* Theorems / propositions

## Incidence geometry

* Undefined terms
    - point
    - line
    - lie on
* Theory
    - **I1** every pair of distinct points lie on a unique line
    - **I2** every line has at least two points
    - **I3** there exist three points that are non-colinear
* Example models
* Defined terms
    - intersect
    - parallel
    - colinear
* Sample theorems / propositions

## Logic

* Implies
* Quantifiers
* Negate

## Neutral axioms 1-3

* Undefined terms
    - point
    - line
    - lie on
    - distance
    - angle measure
* **N1** (EP) there are at least two points
* **N2** (IP) two points determine a line
* **N3** (RP) every line admits a coordinate function f such that \|f(P)-f(Q)\|=PQ
* Defined terms
    - coordinate function
    - between
    - ray
    - segment
    - congruence of segments
    - convex
* Theorems
    - Betweenness can be expressed in terms of coordinates
    - Ruler placement
    - Point construction
  
##  Neutral axioms 4-6

* **N4** (PS) for every line l, the points not on l can be partitioned into two convex sets H1 and H2 such that if P is in H1 and Q is in H2 then the segment PQ meets l.
* Defined terms
    - two sides of a line
    - on the same side  
    - on opposite sides
    - angle
    - interior of an angle
    - betweenness for rays
* Theorems
  - betweenness for points versus betweenness for rays
* **N5** (PP) every angle has a measurement in [0,180); an angle measure of 0 means the two rays of the angle are the same; given any ray and angle measurement, there is a unique angle on each side of the ray with the given measurement; the measures of adjacent angles add up to the measure of the larger angle
* Defined terms
    - congruence of angles
    - acute angle
    - right angle
    - obtuse angle
* Theorems
    - betweenness theorem for rays
    - crossbar theorem
    - linear pair theorem
    - vertical angles theorem
* **N6** (SAS) if AB is congruent to DE, angle ABC is congruent to DEF, and CD is conrguent to EF, then triangle ABC is congruent to DEF.
* Defined terms
    - triangle
    - isosceles triangle
    - congruence of triangles
* Theorems
    - isosceles triangle theorem

## Sample models

* Euclidean distance
* Taxicab distance

## Triangle angles and congruence

* Exterior angle theorem
* Existence and uniqueness of perpendiculars
* SAS is true because we said so
* ASA was proved using SAS and EAT
* AAS was proved using SAS and EAT
* SSA is false, we have counterexamples
* SSA is true for right triangles
